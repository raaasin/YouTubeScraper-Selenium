Well, you’ve come to the right place. 

After this two-part code-first introduction, you’ll have written 100s of lines of TensorFlow code and have hands-on experience with two important problems in machine learning: regression (predicting a number) and classification (predicting if something is one thing or another).

Open a Google Colab (if you’re not sure what this is, you’ll find out soon) window and get ready to code along.

""There is a lot of hype about deep learning and everything AI, however behind all the noise there is a set of solid concepts and algorithms that have massive potential if used in the right way and with the right data. In this talk we will provide you with the key concepts you will need to build a solid understanding around the core of Machine Learning. We will also cover key Deep Learning concepts and examples using Tensorflow that will help you understand the real potential of Deep Learning in practical applications. This talk will provide a theoretical overview that will then be put in practice in the Deep Learning workshop"".

Note: On 7.37 - 7.47 Alejandro says: ""The hard part is how do we learn the hyperparameters of the function itself m and c, that is what ML is about. Learning these weights themselves"". He actually meant that the model learns the weights and biases - the hyperparameters are static (number/size of layers, etc).",20171104,2.2K views,46:57

There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. 
Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what Machine Learning is, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.

We will be covering error back-propagation algorithm, gradient descent, chaining rule etc in upcoming videos. This video on derivatives and partial derivatives is a pre-requisite for those advanced level videos later. Derivative is very much similar to a slope. But it is a function and used for non linear equations. Slope is a constant and is used for linear equations. At the end of this video I have an exercise for you to solve. Please find derivative for those 6 equations and let me know how many you got right out of 6.

1) What is overfitting, underfitting
2) How to address overfitting using L1 and L2 regularization
3) Write code in python and sklearn for housing price prediction where we will see a model overfit when we use simple linear regression. Then we will use Lasso regression (L1 regularization) and ridge regression (L2 regression) to address this overfitting issue

Machine Learning is one of the best skills that you can learn in 2022, especially if you are already in tech. This video will show you exactly how to get started and also I've created a dedicated website so that you guys can easily follow along! There are many stages involved when it comes to learning ML but it doesn't have to be daunting, so it really helps to have a plan. I've broken down the process into 6 different stages.

Stage 1: Math, Linear Algebra
Stage 2: Python
Stage 3: Basic Machine Learning
Stage 4: Advanced Machine Learning
Stage 5: Deep Learning
Stage 6: Projects

This entire process can take on average up to 6-12 months and this is an excellent way to learn while building a really strong foundation!

We will use insurance dataset as a sample and build a logistic regression. Logistic regression uses two step process for classification,
step 1: linear regression to find best fit line for given dataset
step 2: sigmoid or logit function to convert this line into values between 0 and 1
Using sigmoid function one can do a classification.

In this video an AI named Albert learns how to walk to escape 5 rooms I created. The AI was trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a method of Machine Learning which involves rewarding the agent for doing something correctly, and punishing it for doing anything incorrectly. Albert's actions are controlled by a Neural Network that's updated after each attempt in order to try to give Albert more rewards and less punishments over time. Check the pinned comment for more information on how the AI was trained!

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

For those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  

Also, the publication Distill is just utterly beautiful: https://distill.pub/

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

NOTE: Some errors in the video: 
(1) In the video to calculate the RMSE I put the following statement:
rmse=np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions- y_test)**2))

When in fact I meant to put:
rmse=np.sqrt(np.mean(((predictions- y_test)**2)))

You can also use the following statements to calculate RMSE:
1. rmse =np.sqrt(np.mean(((predictions- y_test)**2)))
2. rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.power((np.array(y_test)-np.array(predictions)),2)))
3. rmse = np.sqrt(((predictions - y_test) ** 2).mean())

(2) The preprocessing of data using MinMaxScaler resulted in data leakage, leading to the creation of future bias. Despite this, the code can still be utilized to obtain a basic understanding of Neural Network implementation in Python for classification and prediction purposes.

In this full tutorial course, you will get a solid foundation in reinforcement learning core topics.

The course covers Q learning, SARSA, double Q learning, deep Q learning, and policy gradient methods. These algorithms are employed in a number of environments from the open AI gym, including space invaders, breakout, and others. The deep learning portion uses Tensorflow and PyTorch.

The course begins with more modern algorithms, such as deep q learning and policy gradient methods, and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning.

Then the course teaches some of the fundamental concepts that power all reinforcement learning algorithms. These are illustrated by coding up some algorithms that predate deep learning, but are still foundational to the cutting edge. These are studied in some of the more traditional environments from the OpenAI gym, like the cart pole problem.

In less than 3 hours, you can understand the theory behind modern artificial intelligence, and apply it with several hands-on examples. This is machine learning on steroids! Find out why everyone’s so excited about it and how it really works – and what modern AI can and cannot really do.

In this course, we will cover:

•        Deep Learning Pre-requistes (gradient descent, autodiff, softmax)
•        The History of Artificial Neural Networks
•        Deep Learning in the Tensorflow Playground
•        Deep Learning Details
•        Introducing Tensorflow
•        Using Tensorflow
•        Introducing Keras
•        Using Keras to Predict Political Parties
•        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
•        Using CNNs for Handwriting Recognition
•        Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
•        Using a RNN for Sentiment Analysis
•        The Ethics of Deep Learning
•        Learning More about Deep Learning

At the end, you will have a final challenge to create your own deep learning / machine learning system to predict whether real mammogram results are benign or malignant, using your own artificial neural network you have learned to code from scratch with Python.

Separate the reality of modern AI from the hype – by learning about deep learning, well, deeply. You will need some familiarity with Python and linear algebra to follow along, but if you have that experience, you will find that neural networks are not as complicated as they sound. And how they actually work is quite elegant!

This is hands-on tutorial with real code you can download, study, and run yourself.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the process of building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data. Systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform human-like tasks. It enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human efforts. AI uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make decisions on their own. Machine Learning and Deep learning forms the core of Artificial Intelligence. 

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn. Until recently, neural networks were limited by computing power and thus were limited in complexity. However, advancements in Big Data analytics have permitted larger, sophisticated neural networks, allowing computers to observe, learn, and react to complex situations faster than humans. Deep learning has aided image classification, language translation, speech recognition. It can be used to solve any pattern recognition problem and without human intervention.

What is KNN?
K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification. It classifies a data point based on its neighbors’ classifications. It stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on similar features. 

When Do We Use the KNN Algorithm?
The KNN algorithm is used in the following scenarios:
✅Data is labeled
✅Data is noise-free
✅Dataset is small, as KNN is a lazy learner

Pros and Cons of Using KNN
✅Pros:  Since the KNN algorithm requires no training before making predictions, new data can be added seamlessly, which will not impact the accuracy of the algorithm.
KNN is very easy to implement. There are only two parameters required to implement KNN—the value of K and the distance function (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
✅Cons: The KNN algorithm does not work well with large datasets. The cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each existing point is huge, which degrades performance.
Feature scaling (standardization and normalization) is required before applying the KNN algorithm to any dataset. Otherwise, KNN may generate wrong predictions.

Project Title: Predicting Stock Market Trends Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms Via Continuous and Binary Data; a Comparative Analysis.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Random Forest Regressor.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
The nature of stock market movement has always been ambiguous for investors because of various influential factors. This study aims to significantly reduce the risk of trend prediction with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Four stock market groups, namely diversified financials, petroleum, non-metallic minerals and basic metals from Tehran stock exchange, are chosen for experimental evaluations. This study compares nine machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) and two powerful deep learning methods (Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). Ten technical indicators from ten years of historical data are our input values, and two ways are supposed for employing them. Firstly, calculating the indicators by stock trading values as continuous data, and secondly converting indicators to binary data before using. Each prediction model is evaluated by three metrics based on the input ways. The evaluation results indicate that for the continuous data, RNN and LSTM outperform other prediction models with a considerable difference. Also, results show that in the binary data evaluation, those deep learning methods are the best; however, the difference becomes less because of the noticeable improvement of models' performance in the second way.

Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Use of digital technologies lead to the development of cyberbullying and social media has become a major source for it compared to mobile phones, platforms such as gaming and messaging. Cyberbullying can take several forms that includes sexual remarks, threats, hate mails and posting false things about someone which can be seen and read by millions of people. Compared to traditional bullying, cyberbullying has a longer lasting effect on the victim which can affect them physically or emotionally or mentally or in all the forms. Number of suicides due to cyberbullying has increased in recent years and India is one among the four countries that has more number of cases in cyberbullying. Prevention of cyberbullying has become mandatory in universities and schools due to rising cases since 2015. This paper aims to detect cyberbullying comments automatically using Machine learning and Deep learning techniques. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score used to evaluate the model performance. It is found that Gated Recurrent Unit, a deep learning technique outperformed all the other techniques which are considered in this paper with an accuracy of 95.47%.

Bert Extractive Summarizer : This repo is the generalization of the lecture-summarizer repo. This tool utilizes the HuggingFace Pytorch transformers library to run extractive summarizations. This works by first embedding the sentences, then running a clustering algorithm, finding the sentences that are closest to the cluster's centroids. This library also uses coreference techniques, utilizing the https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref library to resolve words in summaries that need more context. The greedyness of the neuralcoref library can be tweaked in the CoreferenceHandler class.

This process can be applied to any deep learning paper, not just deep reinforcement learning.

In the second part, you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch, to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).

DDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy, coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency, as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.

In this video an AI named Albert learns how to escape 5 rooms I've designed. The AI was trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a method of Machine Learning which involves rewarding the agent for doing something correctly, and punishing it for doing anything incorrectly. Albert's actions are controlled by a Neural Network that's updated after each attempt in order to try to give Albert more rewards and less punishments over time.

Everything in this video (except for the music) was created entirely by myself using Unity. Check the pinned comment for more information on how the AI was trained!

In this video, we look at how machine learning / deep learning / neural networks can be applied to aerodynamic CFD simulations.

Neural Concept
We interviewed Pierre Baqué, CEO of Neural Concept, a Swiss startup developing & offering Deep Learning software. They have developed algorithms to connect 3D shape morphing, deep learning and aerodynamics.

senseFly
senseFly is a Swiss drone company that wanted to improve the flight time of their fixed-wing drones. senseFly, Neural Concept, EPFL (the technical University of Lausanne - École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and AirShaper teamed up to apply Deep Learning to drone design to improve the aerodynamics, as improvements to the lift/drag ratio directly extend the range / increase flight time.

Deep Learning setup
The Neural Concept software can create & explore new 3D shapes to train its network, but it needs an aerodynamics component to give feedback on the lift/drag performance (and other aerodynamic parameters) of each design. For that, the Neural Concept software connected to the AirShaper cloud via an API interface.

Network Training
The training of the network was done in multiple phases with increasing accuracy. The initial warm-up of the network was done using older, in-house simulations from other projects. In the second phase, medium accuracy AirShaper simulations were applied. And in the final phase, high-accuracy AirShaper simulations were used for final tweaking of the network.

Output
Without any design input, the network came up with special drone shapes that partially matched what engineers had been applying for years in practice (anhedral/dihedral setup, ...). The lift/drag ratio was improved by more than 4%. Because the Reynolds number is quite different compared to large aircraft, so were the suggested design solutions.

AIRBUS
Neural Concept worked on the prediction of shock waves (transonic simulations). These results were presented at NEURIPS.

Future of Deep Learning for Aerodynamics
- Today
For industry specific, repetitive tasks, it pays off to train a network so that new designs can be analysed using the predictive model
- Short term
In the short term, machine learning can be used to make existing CFD codes faster and more accurate
- Long term
It's uncertain if it will ever work, but it might be possible to create generic Neural Networks that cover various industry segments, without needing to train the network.

Full Research Paper: https://www.airshaper.com/research

The AirShaper videos cover the basics of aerodynamics (aerodynamic drag, drag & lift coefficients, boundary layer theory, flow separation, reynolds number...), simulation aspects (computational fluid dynamics, CFD meshing, ...) and aerodynamic testing (wind tunnel testing, flow visualization, ...).

We then use those basics to explain the aerodynamics of (race) cars (aerodynamic efficiency of electric vehicles, aerodynamic drag, downforce, aero maps, formula one aerodynamics, ...), drones and airplanes (propellers, airfoils, electric aviation, eVTOLS, ...), motorcycles (wind buffeting, motogp aerodynamics, ...) and more!

We'll also learn how to avoid common issues that make most stock price models overfit in the real world.

We'll start by downloading S&P 500 prices using a package called yfinance.  Then, we'll clean up the data with pandas, and get it ready for machine learning.  

We'll train a random forest model and make predictions using backtesting.  Then, we'll improve the model by adding predictors.  We'll end with next steps you can use to improve the model on your own.

You can find an overview of the project and the code here - https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/sp_500 .

The video outlines the specific workflow for solving a machine learning problem.

The video also outlines the differing requirements for machine learning and deep learning. You’ll learn about the key questions to ask before deciding between machine learning and deep learning.

The choice between machine learning or deep learning depends on your data and the problem you’re trying to solve. MATLAB can help you with both of these techniques – either separately or as a combined approach.",20170404,469K views,03:48

AI vs ML vs DL

My doubt was why these words used interchangeably even when they are not the same. 

I came to a conclusion about this while I was going through AI vs ML vs DL which I'll be briefing in the last.

Hierarchy-

DL is subset of ML which is further a subset of AI.

DL is the way in which ML is achieved. 
ML is the way in which AI is achieved. 

AI- Artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence and trying to to make machine as intelligent as human.

This can be achieved by again mimicking the process by which by which human becomes intelligent and that is learning so here comes machine-learning which tries to make machine learn and make itself intelligent which is again a part of artificial.

So here we came across the term machine learning so machine learning was about described as making machine learn and make itself intelligent but how can we make machine learn?

Here again we go for a mimicking human by which he Learns and uses his intelligence. How does human achieve this?
He does this by or with the help of his brain how does his brain become capable of doing search extremely wonderful things that is because of the neural network in his brain which is a collection for cluster of millions and billions of neurones forming a network which are interlinked through a synapse. Show the process of making this brings a new buzzword that is data science.

So if we back forget now we will learn that data science is the way by which machine learning is achieved and machine learning is the way by which artificial intelligence is achieved as all these three are interlinked.

So There comes a obvious overlap between this three fields that is why in most of the cases which we find, we realise that these words are used interchangeably.

In the images you will find something called hardcoded stuff what I mean by it is is the basic image recognition which we do by using computer vision using open CV library openCV which does not include any kind of artificial intelligence or machine learning or data science completely. But it can be argued that they have a common overlap.

Talking about the examples.

The best example that anyone could give of artificial intelligence is is Google assistant or Siri or Cortana as you have already mentioned these I would like to add voice to text converters that uses AI.

And coming to machine learning I personally I like to give the example of stock prediction.

And for deep learning ANN- artificial neural network ard an example.

Even it can be argued that each of the examples mentioned above can be interchangeably used for examples of others like voice to text converter can be purely achieved through machine learning also.

So it is just the matter of how we realise these three and applied to our our desired need.

All of this is explained in Telugu. So, it your responsibility to share this information with other telugu mates...

To address this we use a technique called data augmentation in deep learning. Data augmentation is used to generate new training samples from current training set using various transformations such as scaling, rotation, contrast change etc. In this video, we will classify flower images and see how our cnn model overfits. After that we will use data augmentation to generate new training samples and see how model performance improves.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

(Chapter 1),"Deep Learning with Python Study Series based on the new edition of the popular book “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet
In this study series, we go through the chapters of the book, explain the theoretical part, run the code, answer questions and discuss various topics related to Deep Learning.
The book covers a vast range of Deep Learning topics. Starting with Machine Learning and Deep Learning basics and using simple examples and easy-to-follow code, it gets us to an advanced level of DL applications. It covers many different fields of DL, from tabular data, image classification, segmentation, and generation to the use of Transformers in NLP. Due to its unique structure, one can become familiar with the code of such projects even without prior knowledge of DL.

👉 SESSION DESCRIPTION
During the session, we went through the 1st chapter of the book.
We got to know the high-level definitions of fundamental concepts of AI, ML, and DL. We saw a short timeline of the development of machine learning during the last decades and also some of the key factors behind deep learning’s rising popularity and future potential.

👉 SESSION STRUCTURE

At each session, we go through the notebook(s) of one chapter of the book. The notebooks can be found here:
https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks
We explain the theoretical background needed to understand the code, read and run the code.
We strongly recommend reading this book since it’s truly well written and it is worth your time. You can also read the book chapter-wise and join specific sessions since the presentations are meant to be stand-alone. Join us on this 3-month journey of weekly study sessions, from zero to advanced Deep Learning!

The material that is used during the study sessions is based on the excellent python notebooks provided by F. Chollet:

What is Linear Regression Analysis?
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Linear regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors:
Which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable?
How significant is the regression line in terms of making predictions with the highest possible accuracy?

Project Title: Malaria Detection using Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Inception_v3 Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Malaria is the deadliest disease in the earth and big hectic work for the health department. The traditional way of diagnosing malaria is by schematic examining blood smears of human beings for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope by lab or qualified technicians. This process is inefficient and the diagnosis depends on the experience and well knowledgeable person needed for the examination. Deep Learning algorithms have been applied to malaria blood smears for diagnosis before. However, practical performance has not been sufficient so far. This paper proposes a new and highly robust machine learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) which automatically classifies and predicts infected cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides.

IEEE Base Paper Title: Intrusion Detection System Using Improved Convolution Neural Network
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Decision Tree Classifier.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Network intrusion detection technology plays an important role in maintaining network security, the main work is to continuously detect the current network status, through the detection of abnormal behavior in the network state, timely warning to alert network managers. The timeliness and accuracy of the intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical to the availability and reliability of the current network. In response to the problems of high false alarm rate, low detection efficiency and limited functions commonly found in IDS, this paper first investigates the application of deep learning techniques to the field of network intrusion detection. With the ability of deep learning algorithms to automatically extract features from intrusion data and avoid the work of manually screening features, an intrusion detection method based on improved convolution neural networks is then proposed. The method is improved by introducing Inception module for optimal intrusion feature extraction based on the traditional convolution neural network. The inception module employs a parallel convolution structure with different filters, using convolution kernels of different sizes on each convolution line for multiple layer-by-layer operations and the various features of network intrusions in the data set are identified and clustered by means of stacking.

Project Title: Alzheimer’s disease Detection using Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: CNN Model Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

Project Abstract:
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurological disorder. For the AD, there is no specific treatment. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease can help patients receive the correct care. Many studies employ statistical and machine learning techniques to diagnose AD. The human-level performance of Deep Learning algorithms has been effectively shown in different disciplines. In the proposed methodology, the MRI data is used to identify the AD and Deep Learning technique is used to classify the present disease. The classification of Alzheimer’s disease using deep learning methods has shown promising results, and successful application in clinical settings requires a combination of high accuracy, short processing time, and generalizability to various populations. In this study, we developed a system of Alzheimer’s disease detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans images which are trained using Kaggle dataset. The models in this study are trained on the same dataset in order to analyse their performances. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture gives the highest accuracy where training accuracy is 86.34% and validation accuracy is 86.45% on the test data that detects AD accurately.

Specifically, we will be exploring the Image Background Removal and Replacement using Machine Learning and AI repository, which contains a collection of pre-trained models and tools for training your own custom models.

We will start by exploring the pre-trained models in the repository, which use advanced computer vision techniques to accurately segment the foreground subject from the background of an image. We will demonstrate how to use these models to remove the background from an image and leave behind only the foreground subject.

Next, we will explore the repository's tools for training your own custom models. This will allow you to create models that are tailored to your specific use case and can achieve even more accurate background removal and replacement.

Finally, we will demonstrate how to use the repository's tools to replace the background of an image with a new background. This can be useful in a variety of applications, from creating photo montages to product photography for e-commerce sites.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a deep understanding of how to use advanced machine learning and AI techniques to remove and replace the background of an image, and you will be equipped with the tools and knowledge to apply these techniques to your own projects.

The simulation was implemented using Unity's ML-Agents framework (https://unity3d.com/machine-learning). The AI consists of a deep Neural Network with 3 hidden layers of 128 neurons each. It is trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a Reinforcement Learning approach.

Basically, the input of the Neural Network are the readings of eight depth sensors, the car's current speed and position, as well as its relative position to the target. The outputs of the Neural Network are interpreted as engine force, braking force and turning force. These outputs can be seen at the top right corner of the zoomed out camera shots.

The AI starts off with random behaviour, i.e. the Neural Network is initialized with random weights. It then gradually learns to solve the task by reacting to environment feedback accordingly. The environment tells the AI whether it is doing good or bad with positive or negative reward signals.
In this project, the AI is rewarded with small positive signals for getting closer to the parking spot, which is outlined in red, and gets a larger reward when it actually reaches the parking spot and stops there. The final reward for reaching the parking spot is dependent on how parallel the car stops in relation to the actual parking position. If the car stops in a 90° angle to the actual parking direction for instance, the AI will only be rewarded a very small amount, relative to the amount it would get for stopping completely parallel to the actual direction.
The AI is penalized with a negative reward signal, when it either drives further away from the parking spot or if it crashes into any obstacles.

The training process shown in this video took about 23 hours on a computer with an i5 (7th or 8th gen) and a GTX 1070 with 100x simulation speed.

With Caffe you can build a net with sophisticated configuration options, and you can access premade nets in an online community.

Deep Learning TV on
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DeepLearningTV/
Twitter: https://twitter.com/deeplearningtv

Caffe is a C++/CUDA library that was developed by Yangqing Jia of Google. The library was initially designed for machine vision tasks, but recent versions support sequences, speech and text, and reinforcement learning. Since it’s built on top of CUDA, Caffe supports the use of GPUs. 

Caffe allows the user to configure the hyper-parameters of a deep net. The layer configuration options are robust and sophisticated – individual layers can be set up as vision layers, loss layers, activation layers, and many others. Caffe’s community website allows users to contribute premade deep nets along with other useful resources. 

Vectorization is achieved through specialized arrays called “blobs”, which help optimize the computational costs of various operations.

Have you ever used the Caffe library in one of your Deep Net projects? Please comment and share your experiences.

This course was created to make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible. The only prerequisite for this course is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course.

This course was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. Jeremy has been using and teaching machine learning for around 30 years. He is the former president of Kaggle, the world's largest machine learning community. Sylvain Gugger is a researcher who has written 10 math textbooks.

Project Title: A Contemporary Technique for Lung Disease Prediction using Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: VGG16 Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
The field of computer science known as machine learning explores algorithms that learn from examples. Classification requires machine learning algorithms that understand how to apply a class label to data from the problem area. An easy-to-understand example is categorizing emails as ""spam"" or ""not spam."" Binary classification predicts one of two classes, whereas multi-class classification predicts one of several classes. In most binary classification tasks, there is one type of normal state and another type of aberrant state. This Project involves how lung disease prediction using x-ray images will predict through the binary classification model implemented, and various python libraries like Tensor Flow, Keras, NumPy, etc. are used. This research project will observe the prediction of lung diseases by using x-ray images and further the output will be predicted with the detailed example and a detailed source code. The implementation will be shown step by step with possible screenshots.

🔴 *What is hate speech?*
Any speech that disparages a group of people because of their race, religion, nationality, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity is considered hate speech. Hate speech is frequently used to promote bigotry and hatred. Additionally, it can be applied to threaten and intimidate others. People may experience loneliness, anxiety, and fear as a result. Hate crimes may also result from it. Additionally, hate speech can harm ties between various racial and ethnic groups. It is crucial to identify hate speech since doing so can assist in stopping these negative impacts.

🟧 Numpy: 
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra and matrices. It is an open-source project, and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

🟧 Pandas:
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

🟧 Countervectorizer
A fantastic utility offered by the Python scikit-learn module is CountVectorizer. It is used to convert a given text into a vector based on the number of times (count) that each word appears across the full text.

🟧 Train test split
Our data is separated into train and test sets using the train test split() technique. We must first separate our data into features (X) and labels (y). Divided into X train, X test, Y train, and Y test, the dataframe is. The model is trained and fitted using the X train and y train sets.

Project Title: Soil Analysis and Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: MobileNetV2 Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
India is the land of agriculture and is among the top three global producers of many crops. The Indian farmer lies at the heart of the agricultural sector yet most Indian farmers remain at the bottom of the social strata. In addition, farmers find it difficult to decide which crop is best suitable and profitable for their soil, in spite of the few technological solutions that exist today, due to the variation in soil types across geographical regions. This paper proposes a crop recommendation system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Random Forest Model to predict the optimal crop to be grown by analyzing various parameters including the region, soil type, yield, selling price, etc. The CNN architecture gave an accuracy of 95.21%, and the Random Forest Algorithm had an accuracy of 75%.

It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.

We'll start by cleaning the EPL match data we scraped in the last video (Web Scraping Football Matches From The EPL With Python [part 1 of 2]). Don't worry if you missed the last video - you'll still be able to download the data.

We'll create predictors and train a machine learning model to predict the winner of each of the football matches.  

Then we'll end by measuring error and making improvements.

You can find the data and code here - https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/football_matches

Many recent advances in computer vision, speech recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have come from Deep Learning research. One key enabler has been the use of GPUs to train bigger models on larger datasets. The Python module ""Theano"" can generate GPU code automatically - so that high level ideas can be implemented in high performance code seamlessly within the Python ecosystem.

In this video an AI named Albert learns how to escape 7 rooms I've designed. The AI was trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a method of Machine Learning which involves rewarding the agent for doing something correctly, and punishing it for doing anything incorrectly. Albert's actions are controlled by a Neural Network that's updated after each attempt in order to try to give Albert more rewards and less punishments over time.

Everything in this video (except for the music) was created entirely by myself using Unity. Check the pinned comment for more information on how the AI was trained!

What is a Decision Tree Algorithm?
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm for solving classification problems. Generally, a decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top and it is known as the Top-Down Approach. Decision trees are used for handling non-linear data sets effectively. The decision tree tool is used in real life in many areas, such as engineering, civil planning, law, and business.

But what does ML actually look like? In part one of Machine Learning Zero to Hero, AI Advocate Laurence Moroney (lmoroney@) walks through a basic Hello World example of building an ML model, introducing ideas which we'll apply in later episodes to a more interesting problem: computer vision.

Note about the dataset:
I tested training the AI on two different datasets, the first Stockfish analyzed the positions up to depth 20. And on the second, depth 0. To my surprise, the AI trained in the second dataset achieved a much better result during the training and during the game, probably because it was easier for AI to learn the instant evaluation of stockfish, if you have another idea why this happened, we can talk about it in the comments below.",20200728,45K views,07:11

Project Title: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection by means of Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: InceptionV3 Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication caused by diabetes that affects the human eye. It is caused by the mutilation of the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the human retina. It’s the most recurrent cause of blindness in the working-age group of people and is highly likely when diabetes is poorly controlled. Although, methods to detect Diabetic Retinopathy exist, they involve manual examination of the retinal image by an Ophthalmologist. The Proposed approach of DR detection aims to detect the complication in an automated manner using Deep Learning. The model is trained using a GPU on 35126 retinal images released publicly by eyePACS on the Kaggle website and achieved an accuracy of approximately 81%.

I researched and tried various methods to get this work, and discovered this to be the easiest and quickest solution.

This will allow you to use your GPU instead of your CPU when training your your neural network. 

This makes it so that iteration through each epoch of your datasets will be completed faster.

Heres a copy of the test functions:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
print(""Num GPUs Available: "", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
tf.test.is_built_with_cuda()
print(tf.version.VERSION)
import sys

This helps the training algorithm to learn the features as we have enough examples for all the different cases. For example, in learning a spam filter, we should have good amount of data which corresponds to emails which are spam and non spam.

This even distribution is not always possible. I'll discuss one of the techniques known as Undersampling that helps us tackle this issue.

Undersampling is one of the techniques used for handling class imbalance. In this technique, we under sample majority class to match the minority class.

Very frequently, press coverage and even practitioners of analytics use the terms Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning interchangeably. Disregarding the difference between AI and machine learning and deep learning.

However, these three concepts do not represent the same. In this video, we are going to break this down for you, giving you examples of use cases making the difference between ai and machine learning and deep learning more clear.

Any device that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success, can be said to have some kind of artificial intelligence, more frequently referred to as A.I. 

More specifically, when a machine has ""cognitive"" capabilities, such as problem solving and learning by example it is usually associated with A.I.

Artificial Intelligence has three different levels: 

Narrow AI: when a computer can perform one task much better than a human; this is where we stand nowadays.

2. General AI: when a machine can successfully perform any given intellectual task that a human being can too

3. Strong AI: when machines can beat humans in many of tasks.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI. 
This is what most applications of AI in business rely on currently. Want to know more about how businesses are applying AI? Watch this video, in which we cover a list of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOEFogy9VSQ&t=21s

And finally, as a subset of machine learning, there’s Deep Learning. It is called “deep” because it makes use of deep artificial neural networks.

In this project we will explore about Bitcoin and also we will predict the price of bitcoin using Machine Learning algorithm.

You can use Google Colab or Kaggle Notebook where you don't need to look at prerequisite of creating virtual environment and downloading TensorFlow.

Here we will use LSTM model in Tensorflow to build our model and then we will predict the bitcoin price.

The data about Bitcoin can be found on Yahoo Finance
Link:  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD


There are few things we can change and improve the performance of the model you can finetune the model as well as increase the data in the dataset , you can add more layers if you want.

Tweak the parameter and see what performance model gives.

(From Scratch #2),"In this video, we implement OCR/image recognition using simple machine learning in Python with no imports! This was streamed live on https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer on 2020/07/06.

Our program uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify images from the mnist and fashion-mnist datasets, meaning it takes digits (1, 2, 3, …) and garments (shoe, t-shirt, …) and guesses what they are (classifies them). It can get up to 93% accuracy on mnist. I wanted this to be a simple introduction to machine learning for those not very familiar with it.

The full code including more details is available at https://git.sr.ht/~vladh/clumsycomputer/tree/main/item/from-scratch-2-ocr

Because this is a recording of a live stream, you'll hear me sometimes talking to the chat.

If you'd like to see more, please follow the clumsy computer Twitch channel at https://twitch.tv/clumsycomputer.

If you have any questions, write a comment or contact me on https://twitter.com/clumsycomputer.

What would you like to see me code from scratch next? Let me know in the comments! :)

Project Title: Bird Species Identification Using Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Xception Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

Project Abstract:
Bird identification is a difficult undertaking that frequently results in ambiguous labelling. Even skilled bird watchers dispute on the species of a bird when presented with an image of one. It's a demanding task that tests both people and computers' visual talents. Although different bird species have the same core set of elements, their shape and appearance can change drastically. Due to differences in lighting and background, as well as great diversity in stance, intraclass variance is high (e.g., flying birds, swimming birds, and perched birds that are partially occluded by branches). Human knowledge of a species is insufficient to reliably identify a bird species, as it necessitates a great deal of skill in the subject of ornithology. Our study intends to use machine learning to assist amateur bird watchers in identifying bird species from photographs. This research provides a deep neural network-based automated model for automatically identifying the species of a bird supplied as the test data set. For 400 different bird species, the model was trained and evaluated. Experimental analysis on dataset shows that our proposed Xception architecture model achieved an accuracy of bird identification with Training Accuracy of 99% and Validation Accuracy of 97%.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

Using FastAPI, we'll create a web server that exposes a /translate route and a /results route. Clients will post their translation request to the /translate route, and get the translation results from /results. The server will use a sqlite database to store the translations. On the backend, we'll use async and a pretrained deep learning language model to run the translation job.

By the end, we'll have a web server that can run translation jobs quickly. This server can easily be extended to translate more languages, or add more options.

For any early-stage ML startup founders, Amplify Partners would love to hear from you via 3blue1brown@amplifypartners.com

To learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
The book walks through the code behind the example in these videos, which you can find here: 
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

MNIST database:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Also check out Chris Olah's blog: 
http://colah.github.io/
His post on Neural networks and topology is particular beautiful, but honestly all of the stuff there is great.

And if you like that, you'll *love* the publications at distill:
https://distill.pub/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: 
https://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI
https://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs

""But I've already voraciously consumed Nielsen's, Olah's and Welch's works"", I hear you say.  Well well, look at you then.  That being the case, I might recommend that you continue on with the book ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.

In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from. This data is fed to the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. The trained model tries to search for a pattern and give the desired response. 

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Like traditional types of data analysis, here, the algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

Project Title: A Road Accident Prediction Model Using Data Mining Techniques.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: Adaboost Classifier Algorithm.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
Due to the exponentially increasing number of vehicles on the road, the number of accidents occurring on a daily basis is also increasing at an alarming rate. With the high number of traffic incidents and deaths these days, the ability to forecast the number of traffic accidents over a given time is important for the transportation department to make scientific decisions. In this scenario, it will be good to analyze the occurrence of accidents so that this can be further used to help us in coming up with techniques to reduce them. Even though uncertainty is a characteristic trait of majority of the accidents, over a period of time, there is a level of regularity that is perceived on observing the accidents occurring in a particular area. This regularity can be made use of in making well informed predictions on accident occurrences in an area and developing accident prediction models. In this paper, we have studied the inter relationships between road accidents, condition of a road and the role of environmental factors in the occurrence of an accident. We have used Adaboost classifier.

Project Title: Brain Tumour Detection Using Deep Learning.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: CNN Model Architecture.
Web Framework: Flask.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base paper Abstract:
The motivation behind this study is to detect brain tumour and provide better treatment for the sufferings. The abnormal growths of cells in the brain are called tumours and cancer is a term used to represent malignant tumours. Usually CT or MRI scans are used for the detection of cancer regions in the brain. Positron Emission Tomography, Cerebral Arteriogram, Lumbar Puncture, Molecular testing are also used for brain tumour detection. In this study, MRI scan images are taken to analyse the disease condition. Objective this research works are i) identify the abnormal image ii) segment tumour region. Density of the tumour can be estimated from the segmented mask and it will help in therapy. Deep learning technique is employed to detect abnormality from MRI images. Multi level thresholding is applied to segment the tumour region. Number of malignant pixels gives the density of the affected region.

About the ML Master's Program

Edureka’s Machine Learning Masters Program makes you proficient in techniques like Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Natural Language Processing. It includes training on the latest advancements and technical approaches in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning such as Deep Learning, Graphical Models and Reinforcement Learning.

----------------------

Why Learn Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a concept which allows the machine to learn from examples and experience, and that too without being explicitly programmed. So instead of you writing the code, what you do is you feed data to the generic algorithm, and the algorithm/machine builds the logic based on the given data.

Project Title: Detection of Stress in IT Employees using Machine Learning Technique.
Implementation: Python.
Algorithm / Model Used: CNN Model Architecture.
Cost (In Indian Rupees): Rs.5000/

IEEE Base Paper Abstract: 
The objective of this paper is to apply machine learning and visual processing to identify overworked IT employees. Our technology is an improved version of older stress detection systems that did not include live detection or personal counseling. Stress detection methods that don't include real-time monitoring or individual counselling are being updated in this research. A survey is used to collect data on employees' mental stress levels in order to provide effective stress management solutions. In order to get the most out of your employees, this paper will look at stress management and how to create a healthy, spontaneous work environment.

This is a problem which is trivial to a human but much more difficult for a machine, hence why we'll use some machine learning to solve it.

We'll have a high-level overview of the problem, load the data in Python, pre-process the data, build the fully connected network, train and evaluate it on our data, plot a confusion matrix and finally take a look at the mis-classified data to see how they look like and think about why they were not classified correctly by the network.

The only prerequisites for this tutorial are Python programming knowledge, and the will to learn ;) Everything else I'll explain on the way. Please let me know if you have any questions at all.

Activation Function

Summation function for a particular node combines inputs of all the nodes in the previous layers (weighted sum) and adds bias corresponding to the node. The output of summation function acts as input to activation function.

Activation function is one of the most important part of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).  It determines output of a node for given input.  We have choice of several activation functions depending on whether the node is in a hidden layer or output layer. Nodes in input layer do not have activation function. They just let the input pass as it is.  The activation function also imports non-linearity to ANN, i.e., our network can learn any complex non-linear relationship if appropriate activation functions are used.

Summation Function and Activation Function together are also called Transfer Function of the neuron.

Commonly Used Activation Function

1. Step function
2. Signum (sign) function
3. Linear Function
4. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function
5. Leaky ReLU ( Leaky Rectified Linear Unit Function ) 
6. tanh function
7. Sigmoid function
8. Softmax funciton",20200425,33K views,10:18

Agriculture is one of the major and the least paid occupation in India. Machine learning can bring a boom in the agriculture field by changing the income scenario through growing the optimum crop. This paper focuses on predicting the yield of the crop by applying various machine learning techniques. The outcome of these techniques is compared on the basis of mean absolute error. The prediction made by machine learning algorithms will help the farmers to decide which crop to grow to get the maximum yield by considering factors like temperature, rainfall, area, etc.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

First, a disclaimer - Do NOT invest any money in any type of trading bot or algorithmic engine that you are not willing to lose. I gave this trading bot $2000 because I was willing to lose $2000 to make a great video for my AI Wizards out there. ChatGPT is unique in its capabilities as a large language model because of its ability to remember the context of of a conversation. This AI is helping me build MVPs a lot faster and I want us all to take part in this revolution. The tools used in this tutorial are the Alpaca API for live trading data, Python for Programming, FinRL for Deep Reinforcement Learning and Vercel for live deployment.

Building real-world projects is a great way to apply & improve your machine learning skills. In this workshop, we will walk through the process of building a classical machine learning project using Python & Scikit-learn.

Here's what the workshop covers:
1. Finding a real-world dataset on Kaggle
2. Downloading and exploring the data
3. Preparing the data for machine learning
4. Creating hardcoded and baseline models
5. Making predictions and submitting to Kaggle
6. Trying different models & tuning hyperparameters
7. Feature engineering, ensembling & other optimizations
8. Tracking experiments & results systematically
9. Incorporating ideas from public notebooks & discussions
10. Documenting and publishing your work online

The workshop lasts 3 hours, and we write all the code from scratch, starting with a blank Jupyter notebook. Attendees will be able to ask questions live. A recording of the workshop will be shared later, which you can use to follow along and create your own ML project.

Prerequisites
This workshop assumes some prior knowledge of classical machine learning. If you're new to machine learning, you can get started with our free course ""Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs"" at https://zerotogbms.com .

I explain how they are derived and how they work. The course is motivated by a problem - building a machine to predict hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. I start with a very simple linear binary classifier (the Perceptron) and with each lecture I improve the model until I have a Deep Neural Network.

All the code is written in Python and is hosted on GitHub (link below). I make use of NumPy and a tiny bit of Pandas and Matplotlib. No neural network libraries (e.g. TensorFlow and PyTorch) are used in this course, as it is about understanding fundamentals - not practical construction.

Chatzizaharias,"While machine learning is often used for image recognition, speech recognition and the such, people tend to forget that there is another industry making full use of machine learning. The games industry. Within the games industry companies have been using machine learning to train their NPCs (non-player characters) a plethora of things. From basic combat behavior to full blown city building. During this session Alexander will show you what you can expect from using machine learning agents in Unity3D, an industry standard game engine. Alexander will demonstrate how to implement basic machine learning agents in Unity and how to train them! But the agents won't be trained to do standard stuff.

Introduction to Transformers
Andrej Karpathy: https://karpathy.ai/

Since their introduction in 2017, transformers have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now, transformers are finding applications all over Deep Learning, be it computer vision (CV), reinforcement learning (RL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Speech or even Biology. Among other things, transformers have enabled the creation of powerful language models like GPT-3 and were instrumental in DeepMind's recent AlphaFold2, that tackles protein folding.

In this speaker series, we examine the details of how transformers work, and dive deep into the different kinds of transformers and how they're applied in different fields. We do this by inviting people at the forefront of transformers research across different domains for guest lectures.

La IA:
La inteligencia artificial (IA) es la inteligencia llevada a cabo por máquinas. En ciencias de la computación, una máquina «inteligente» ideal es un agente flexible que percibe su entorno y lleva a cabo acciones que maximicen sus posibilidades de éxito en algún objetivo o tarea. Coloquialmente, el término inteligencia artificial se aplica cuando una máquina imita las funciones «cognitivas» que los humanos asocian con otras mentes humanas, como por ejemplo: «percibir», «razonar», «aprender» y «resolver problemas».

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature engineering is the process of creating new input features for machine learning. Each input feature is a column of data that the machine learning model uses to make its predictions or classifications. Feature engineering makes a machine learning model more accurate by providing it with more or better input, making it one of the most important steps in building an effective model.

The major steps involved in feature engineering are typically:

Brainstorming or Testing Features: The first step is to consider what features could potentially improve the performance of your model. This might be based on your understanding of the problem, domain knowledge, or previous experiences.

Creating Features: Once you have an idea of what features to create, the next step is to create them. This could involve anything from simple arithmetic operations to complex calculations.

Checking how the Features work with your Model: After creating features, the next step is to include them in your model and see how they affect its performance. If a feature improves your model, you'll want to keep it. If not, you can discard it.

Iterating on your Features: After testing your features, you might have new ideas for features to create. Alternatively, you might find that slight tweaks to your features improve their performance. Thus, this process is often iterative.

We will then examine some examples of modern machine-learning applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Afterward, we dive into linear regression, which is a fundamental machine-learning technique for predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. We will cover the basic concepts of linear regression, including the cost function, gradient descent, and regularization.

We also cover the concepts of bias and variance and how they can impact the accuracy of machine-learning models.

Finally, we will introduce maximum likelihood, a powerful statistical technique used to estimate the parameters of a model by maximizing the likelihood of observing the data. We will show how maximum likelihood can be used to estimate the parameters of linear regression models and other types of machine learning models.

😱DANGEROUS! How Flesh Eating Bacteria Kills?

Flesh-eating wound bacteria create a severe infection in your wound and can make you dead within 24 hours. Like the video and let's understand the journey of this wound bacteria from creating severe infection to your death.
Necrotizing Fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection, and a total of 4 types of bacteria are responsible for this infection. This bacteria enters the body through cuts or wounds and targets the fascia layer present under the skin layer. Let me tell you that these bacteria do not feed on your flesh.

This bacteria destroys the soft tissues of your fascia layer very rapidly by releasing some very harmful toxins, and they also keep on increasing their population rapidly. Now; these toxins start to pollute your bloodstream, which causes severe pain around the wound area, inflammation, and fever. When the infection level increases, the skin around the wound gets darker and black-colored blisters start to appear on the skin.

With time, these bacteria make the condition of your wound worse. People with weak immune systems lose their life because of the multi-organ failure condition caused by this rare and life-threatening infection.

The `input()` function allows you to prompt the user for input and returns the text entered by the user as a string.

Here's a simple example:

```python
name = input(""Enter your name: "")
print(""Hello, "" + name + ""!"")
```

In this example, the program prompts the user to enter their name. The `input()` function takes a string argument that represents the prompt. The user can then type their name and press enter. The entered text is stored in the `name` variable, which can be used later in the program.

The program then prints a greeting message using the entered name.

When you run this code, it will display the prompt, wait for the user to enter text, and then print the greeting message.

Keep in mind that the `input()` function always returns a string, so if you want to perform numerical operations with the input, you may need to convert it to the appropriate data type using functions like `int()` or `float()`.

Tesla is showing off how well its Optimus robots can walk in a new video showcasing their movements. The video highlights advances made in the nearly two years since CEO Elon Musk vowed to create the humanoid robots and brought a human in a robot suit onstage to kick off the project.


Tesla shared a video of its humanoid bot this week that shows the bounds it has made (literally) since the first shaky prototype was revealed at the marque’s AI day last year.


LangChain is a Python framework for developing applications powered by language models. In this video we take a look at LangChain, see how it works, and what you can do with it!

In this video we’ll walk you through:
- GPT4
- LangChain
- Generative AI
- HuggingFaceHub
- Optimization Technique Deep Learning
- Multimodal
- Deep Learning
- ChatGPT 
- palm-e Models 
- VALLE
- GOOGLE pathway 
-GOOGLE palm2 
- Humanoid Robots
-Tesla Bot 

OpenAI has officially announced GPT-4  the latest version of its incredibly popular large language model powering artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that utilizes the language models of GPT-3 and GPT-4 for interactive communication.  In other words you can use chatgpt with gpt4.  A Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) is a sophisticated neural network architecture used to train large language models (LLMs). It makes use of large amounts of publicly available Internet text to simulate human communication.

Main improvements:
* It's multimodal (what it is is in video)
* Longer context length 
* Better performance 
* More safer

Versatility: ChatGPT is a flexible language model that can participate in a variety of conversational tasks, making it appropriate for a wide range of applications.
Natural language processing: It can comprehend and produce text that sounds like human speech, making conversations with it more interesting and natural.
Knowledge and information: ChatGPT has access to a wealth of knowledge, enabling it to offer solutions, justifications, and recommendations based on its pre-trained expertise.
Capabilities for learning: It can be tailored for certain activities or domains, enabling superior performance in niche circumstances.
24/7 accessibility: ChatGPT is always available, offering regular and dependable support.
Negative aspects of ChatGPT:Lack of real-world awareness: It relies on patterns and correlations in training data and lacks a realistic grasp of the world, which might result in inaccurate or absurd responses.Consistent replies: The model appears inconsistent because even little variations in the query's wording or order might provide noticeably different responses.ChatGPT is quite sensitive to the way questions are framed, so users must experiment with rephrasing in order to get the desired results.Bias propagation: Due to biases contained in the training data, it may unintentionally provide biassed or discriminatory replies.Cutoff for limited knowledge: Since ChatGPT's training data only extends until September 2021, it can be unaware of current affairs or advancements.Ethical considerations: To address potential problems, responsible use and protections are required.

It allows users to manipulate images by dragging points on the image. The tool is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). GAN is a type of machine learning model. It can generate realistic images. Drag Your GAN uses the GAN to create a new image. This image is based on the original image. It incorporates the changes that the user has made. It can replace Photoshop in near future. I'm so excited to try this out!

Python (Session 2): Practical 5G Throughput Simulation with Python

In the previous session, we developed a basic 5G Interactive Throughput Calculator that takes some inputs from the user and generates the peak throughput for the given configuration. However, this approach cannot be used for general purposes as most of the users will be in different radio conditions and hence, they will get different throughput levels. So, in this session, we will convert that basic 5G Tool into a more practical version which will be able to provide throughput for 5G Users in various radio conditions. This means that we will add more input parameters including MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme), CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) and BLER (Block Error Rate). Meanwhile, we will also increase our knowledge of Python as we will introduce the concept of Python Lists, improving the interaction by creating choice and learning about IF and IF-ELSE statements. So, do have a look as I have tried to cover both 5G and Python simultaneously!

The MCS and CQI tables discussed in the session are given below. You can copy them from here and use them in your own test code!

Welcome to ""Hands-on Kafka in Python,"" a comprehensive section where we dive deep into Apache Kafka and explore its powerful capabilities using Python. where we'll focus on building a Kafka producer and consumer in Python.

 Throughout this section, we'll take a step-by-step approach, carefully explaining each line of code, ensuring you have a solid understanding of Kafka concepts and how they relate to Python. But before we jump into the code, let's talk about why Kafka and Python make a great combination.
Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, has gained immense popularity for its ability to handle large-scale, real-time data processing. Python, being a versatile and widely adopted programming language, provides an excellent ecosystem for developing Kafka applications.

In this section, we'll work with the latest version of Kafka (version 3 or above), ensuring that you're up to date with the latest features and improvements. This hands-on approach will equip you with the skills needed to confidently work with Kafka in real-world scenarios.

As promised, you'll have access to all the code we write in this course as resources. This will allow you to follow along, experiment, and reinforce your learning by exploring and modifying the code to suit your specific needs.

Practical Python Use Cases (Session 1): How To Create
Basic 5G Interactive Tools
The idea about these Python sessions is to start from the basics and beginner level and discuss how we can use Python to perform various calculations, simulations and automations related to Telecom technologies like 4G, LTE, VOLTE and 5G.
